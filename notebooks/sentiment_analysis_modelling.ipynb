    "Overall Research Questions:\n",
    "1) How do customers define 'good' service, and how does the new script shift those definitions?\n",
    "2) What aspects of service (clarity, empathy, agent personality) drive variance in sentiment?\n",
    "3) Does the new script systematically change perceptions or emotional tone, particularly for high-value segments like VOLT?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, specific to sentiment analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare:\n",
    "    - Sentiment distribution between treatment vs. control\n",
    "    - Strength of sentiment for VOLT vs. general sample\n",
    "- What topics co-occur with negative or positive sentiment?\n",
    "- Any shifts in emotional tone driven by the new script?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our comment data was already cleaned (but still has some typos), it should be ready for sentiment analysis, using LTR_COMMENT_CLEAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "An appropriate model is Google Cloud's Natural Language API. This model is quite robust and can handle typos and the extensive nuances of hastily typed, somewhat messy customer feedback, as similar text comprises a significant chuck of its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Google Cloud's Natural Language API is designed to handle natural, conversational text and can automatically detect language and process informal language patterns.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the text cleaning steps involved in sentiment analysis are far less than in topic modelling, as models such as this one adapt to punctuation, capitalization, and the natural organic communication patterns in our data.\n",

This resulted in 3 hours on the phone with customer services being put through to different operators, on 2 occasions my whole order was processed again although I explained that I had already done all this online and just wanted to change the address. The operators where both trying to be helpful and I appreciate that but the process was very draining and 3 hours is a ridiculous amount of time.\n",

It took an hour on the phone to customer services to correct this. But the last message I got said 'Let's lock this in' and although the attached CSS contract has the correct M250 entry it is different from my pre contract CSS as it has a £30 fee added that shouldn't be there, it does not have the Wi-Fi hub listed under Broadband services, and it is missing the details of what minimum speeds to expect, etc. I contacted customer services again and asked them to rectify these errors and send me the amended contract. I got a message that my first bill will be £39.98, but I am still waiting for the amended contract.\n",

      "Comment: The agent who set up my account ,said she would give us £150 and free Netflix , she never did , I was on the telephone for 6 hours to 12 different agents to try to resolve the new account and to receive what the agent said she would give us for signing up to a new contract. It is beyond comprehension how some of your staff can be fundamentally dishonest. After the 6 hours and speaking to 12 different people who to be honest had not a clue what I was talking about , I finally got through to a agent called Cory who eventually tried to sort the total mess out . Very very disappointed,I was with sky for 12 years and had no problems ,but I wanted to leave because of cost . Then the same day someone appeared at my door and said where would you like us to put the cable ,I was unaware anyone was coming to put in a cable .Communication between your agents and customers is total unacceptable .\n",

He assisted first with selecting a package, followed then by contacting my seller to prompt to let company know about switching off their service at that property. I called back when confirmed with the seller exchange dates a week or so later using Mark's number provided. Mark remembered my conversation from a week ago, despite speaking to many people in the time between. Once again Mark provided absolute pristine customer service, and without Mark's assistance on the first call you never know whether I would have continued with company or looked for other options.

When I rang to cancel I was told there was at least a 7 day delay that I was going to have to pay for - even though I was cancelling the very next day after activation the service. I was also told there was a high connection charge - which was not the case for when I registered for the service I was told there would be no connection charge. When this was pointed out the telephone operator checked and agreed there was no connection charge but I would be paying for the service for the next seven days at least. I am not happy about this - I used the service for two days at most - the day it was activated and the day it was cancelled. (wed 3rd May and Thursday 4th May) and I didn't even connect up the TV or use the company tv box.\n",

You can feel the contempt in operator voices (sniggering and laughing when you say you cannot understnd what they are saying - feels intentional) and cannot quite get all of the words due to very strong accents. Your only saving grace is the physical connection and stability of that. Thankfully, because connection quality is good I rarely (if ever - Thank Goodness) have to contact your call centers. Would not touch with a barge pole otherwise. Take a look at Now Broadband whos operators are absolutely marvellous. Lessons learned or brushed under the carpet? Haha\n",

To elaborate, there was a hedge against the wall where the cable had to come through, most modern day engineers would stop the job at that point and cite the hedge as an obstruction, but not Stevie, he got in to the hedge to ensure the job got done.

      "Comment: I have had to call company everyday. 15/05/23 spoke to at least 10 different people in 10 different departments. Each time having to re-explain the situation, one member said yes they can activate internet but in a different department, got to that department they said it couldn't be done... No manager was available to talk to. I have been told activation will happen on 3 different dates due to companys delays. This has caused me to loose wages from work as I work from home and rely on the internet to work. My son is disabled and uses the internet to communicate, so has had 3 days of non communication so far. I am speaking to other suppliers and will be cancelling with company within my 30day cooling off period. I will not under any circumstances recommend company and I will be publishing my experience on social media. You need to get your departments organised, leadership needs to be held accountable and staff clearly need more adequate training.\n",

In order to get this sorted I called up and after an hour and a half of being lied to by two members of the team I was finally transferred to someone who could have helped in minutes, which he did. Although the contract still has the charge on it. I can't believe that the staff are so badly trained. When I've tried to complain a member of the complaints team tried to convince me not to. I asked to speak to his manager which in fairness he did but the manager came on saying everything was resolved 'I can't understand why you would want to talk to a manager?' Like he was the prime minister and not a supervisor in a call centre! Not sure why I've even bothered recounting this here, not like anyone at company cares.\n",

As I am renting the property I cannot give permission for this work without precise details of what will be involved and the impact on the landlord's property and garden. This should have been made clear to me at the time of discussing the service that company Media could provide.

      "Comment: Your customer service is awful and you really need to ditch the overseas call centers. Kindness and understanding in the voice go a long way. You can feel the contempt in operator voices (sniggering and laughing when you say you cannot understnd what they are saying - feels intentional) and cannot quite get all of the words due to very strong accents. Your only saving grace is the physical connection and stability of that. Thankfully, because connection quality is good I rarely (if ever - Thank Goodness) have to contact your call centers. Would not touch with a barge pole otherwise. Take a look at Now Broadband whos operators are absolutely marvellous. Lessons learned or brushed under the carpet? Haha\n",

      "Comment: I moved into a property last June and was unable to enjoy the services that company Media provided me at my previous address for over 30 years, due to the previous owner declining the installation as she already had Sky installed. I can only assume that she was not sure how the cable would be run as the property is not directly on the kerb line and had its own drive with the house being set back. I did ask if the service was available before I move and was advised it was not at that time, but was advised that company Media were always expanding their services and I should enquire again in the new year. I enquired again in early May and the Sales operative was extremely helpful and was able to call me back and advise me that she would book a site visit to carry out a survey and was hopeful that I would get the service that I had been missing for the past 10 months. The engineers called and we discussed the route and since then things have been moving along swiftly. Termination box at the end of the property access installed last week, civils works and the running of cable yesterday, and full install into property due next Monday. What's Not to like about that. At all times I have been met with a Positive Can Do attitude and a degree of curtesy that I have found to be lacking from other companies over recent years. WELL DONE company MEDIA.\n",
