    "#### Comment pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "For both topic extraction and sentiment analysis modelling, it would be useful to firstly correct the typos, non-regular characters and other abnormal appearances in the raw comment texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we should keep punctuation, capitalization, information language, misspellings, and emotional expressions. However, we do want to correct things like:\n",
    "- character encoding issues: e.g. \"wÃ¡s\" → \"was\",  \"I don¬\"t know much\" → \"I don't know much\"\n",
    "- Unicode encoding artifacts\n",
    "- Excessive whitespace\n",
    "- comments that are literally 'na' or some variation\n",
    "- typo fixes\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this step, we can be sure in the integrity of our text data for further processing adapted to topic modelling/sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we'll apply some function based methods to address the unicode artifacts, character encoding, and na's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can rely on an LLM for fixing basic typos, while making sure to check any changed responses. If scaling this approach, a lightweight model would be used, but in our small sample, we can do a many-shot run with a model like local deepseek-r1, checking any changes. Likewise, both topic modelling and sentiment analysis models are often robust to typos (often through the use of embeddings models) so this step might not be necessary. (UPDATED: Step deemed too time-inefficient to do)"

      "Sample 47: I moved into a property last June and was unable to enjoy the services that company Media provided me at my previous address for over 30 years, due to the previous owner declining the installation as she already had Sky installed. I can only assume that she was not sure how the cable would be run as the property is not directly on the kerb line and had its own drive with the house being set back. I did ask if the service was available before I move and was advised it was not at that time, but was advised that company Media were always expanding their services and I should enquire again in the new year. I enquired again in early May and the Sales operative was extremely helpful and was able to call me back and advise me that she would book a site visit to carry out a survey and was hopeful that I would get the service that I had been missing for the past 10 months. The engineers called and we discussed the route and since then things have been moving along swiftly. Termination box at the end of the property access installed last week, civils works and the running of cable yesterday, and full install into property due next Monday. What's Not to like about that. At all times I have been met with a Positive Can Do attitude and a degree of curtesy that I have found to be lacking from other companies over recent years. WELL DONE company MEDIA.\n",

Your only saving grace is the physical connection and stability of that. Thankfully, because connection quality is good I rarely (if ever - Thank Goodness) have to contact your call centers.

      "Original Sample 47: I moved into a property last June and was unable to enjoy the services that company Media provided me at my previous address for over 30 years, due to the previous owner declining the installation as she already had Sky installed. I can only assume that she was not sure how the cable would be run as the property is not directly on the kerb line and had its own drive with the house being set back. I did ask if the service was available before I move and was advised it was not at that time, but was advised that company Media were always expanding their services and I should enquire again in the new year. I enquired again in early May and the Sales operative was extremely helpful and was able to call me back and advise me that she would book a site visit to carry out a survey and was hopeful that I would get the service that I had been missing for the past 10 months. The engineers called and we discussed the route and since then things have been moving along swiftly. Termination box at the end of the property access installed last week, civils works and the running of cable yesterday, and full install into property due next Monday. What's Not to like about that. At all times I have been met with a Positive Can Do attitude and a degree of curtesy that I have found to be lacking from other companies over recent years. WELL DONE company MEDIA.\n",

You can feel the contempt in operator voices (sniggering and laughing when you say you cannot understnd what they are saying - feels intentional) and cannot quite get all of the words due to very strong accents. Your only saving grace is the physical connection and stability of that. Thankfully, because connection quality is good I rarely (if ever - Thank Goodness) have to contact your call centers. Would not touch with a barge pole otherwise. Take a look at Now Broadband whos operators are absolutely marvellous. Lessons learned or brushed under the carpet? Haha\n",
