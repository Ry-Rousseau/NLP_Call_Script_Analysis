pilot,,359189261,10,"I moved into a property last June and was unable to enjoy the services that company Media provided me at my previous address for over 30 years, due to the previous owner declining the installation as she already had Sky installed. I can only assume that she was not sure how the cable would be run as the property is not directly on the kerb line and had its own drive with the house being set back. I did ask if the service was available before I move and was advised it was not at that time, but was advised that company Media were always expanding their services and I should enquire again in the new year. I enquired again in early May and the Sales operative was extremely helpful and was able to call me back and advise me that she would book a site visit to carry out a survey and was hopeful that I would get the service that I had been missing for the past 10 months. The engineers called and we discussed the route and since then things have been moving along swiftly. Termination box at the end of the property access installed last week, civils works and the running of cable yesterday, and full install into property due next Monday. What's Not to like about that. At all times I have been met with a Positive Can Do attitude and a degree of curtesy that I have found to be lacking from other companies over recent years.
